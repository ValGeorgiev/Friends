                                    Jennifer Aniston portrays Rachel Green, a fashion enthusiast and
                                    Monica Geller's best friend from childhood. Rachel first moves in with
                                    Monica in season one after nearly marrying Barry Farber, whom she realizes
                                    she does not love. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an
                                    on-again-off-again relationship throughout the series.
                                    Rachel dates other men during the series, such as an Italian neighbor, Paolo,
                                    in season one, her client Joshua Bergin in season four, her assistant Tag in
                                    season seven, and Joey Tribbiani in season ten. Rachelâ€™s first job is as a
                                    waitress at the coffeehouse Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant
                                    buyer at Bloomingdale's in season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five.
                                    Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma in "The One Where Rachel Has a Baby,
                                    Part Two" at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series
                                    Ross and Rachel finally confess their love for each other, and
                                    Rachel gives up a job in Paris to be with him.

                                    Lisa Kudrow portrays Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric masseuse and self-taught musician.
                                    Phoebe lived in uptown New York with her mother until her mother committed suicide
                                    and Phoebe took to the streets. Phoebe is ditsy but street smart, and writes
                                    and sings her own quirky songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an
                                    "evil" identical twin named Ursula, who shares Phoebeâ€™s quirkiness, but unlike
                                    Phoebe seems to be selfish and uncaring. Phoebe is childlike and innocent in disposition.
                                    She tends to use her past misfortunes such as her motherâ€™s suicide as sympathy ploys.
                                    Phoebe has three serious relationships: Gary (the cop) in season five, an
                                    on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten, and David
                                    in season one, which ends when he moves to Minsk on a research grant.
                                    They reconcile whenever he returns, but she eventually rejects him for Mike
                                    in season nine when both of them propose to her, leading to their marriage at season ten.

                                    Matt LeBlanc portrays Joey Tribbiani, a struggling actor and food lover
                                    who becomes famous for his role on soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray.
                                    Joey is a simple-minded womanizer with many short-term girlfriends.
                                    Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring, and well-intentioned.
                                    Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" in his attempts
                                    to win over women, including Rachel's sister Jill. Joey rooms with his best
                                    friend Chandler for years and later a while with Rachel.
                                    He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells
                                    Joey that she does not share the same feelings.
                                    They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will
                                    not work due to their friendship and more importantly Rachel's complicated
                                    relationship with Ross, they return to being friends.

                                    Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an executive in statistical analysis
                                    and data reconfiguration for a large multinational corporation.
                                    Chandler quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency
                                    during season nine. Chandler has a peculiar family history being the son of
                                    an erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father.

                                    need to break an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with women when

                                    David Schwimmer portrays Ross Geller, Monica Geller's older brother,
                                    a paleontologist working at the Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor
                                    of paleontology at New York University. Ross is a sweet-natured man of good humor,
                                    although he is often clumsy and socially awkward. Ross is involved in an
                                    on-again-off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series.
                                    He has three failed marriages during the series: Rachel, Emily, and Carol,
                                    a lesbian who is also the mother of his son, Ben. His failed love life is potentially
                                    due to his paranoia and jealousy in relationships, and his divorces become
                                    a point of humor within the series. He and Rachel have a daughter Emma
                                    by the end of season eight, and they confess that they are still in love
                                    with each other in the final episode.
