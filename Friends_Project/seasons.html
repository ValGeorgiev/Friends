            <p>
                The first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler,
                and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after running away from her wedding to her fiancé
                Barry and moves into her friend from high school's (Monica’s) apartment with her. Ross, who
                has had a crush on Rachel since the two of them were in high school, constantly attempts to
                tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact
                that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor
                and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of "crazy" attribute
                to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide.
                However the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with girlfriend Janice
                (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently returns in later seasons. At the end of the season, Chandler
                accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season
                ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross’ arrival from a trip.

                The second season begins with Rachel waiting at the gate for Ross to declare her love for him.
                However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school.
                Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although
                the characters eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a part in a fictional version of
                the soap opera Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after conflicts with the show's writers,
                claiming that he writes many of his own lines. Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one.
                Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior.
                In the season finale, they end their relationship when they realize that unlike Monica, Richard does not want children.

                Season three takes on a significantly greater serialized format. Rachel begins working at Bloomingdale's,
                an upscale department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take
                a break; and Ross, hurt and drunk, sleeps with someone else, causing Rachel to break up with him.
                In the meantime, Chandler has a hard time dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his
                parents' divorce. After believing she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow),
                Phoebe becomes acquainted with her half-brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother (Teri Garr).
                Joey develops a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), and Monica begins a

                a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice
                (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing
                a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a
                one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale),
                and the season finale features their wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel decides
                to attend Ross and Emily's wedding. While saying his vows, Ross uses the wrong name at the altar

                Season five features Monica and Chandler trying to keep their new relationship a secret from
                their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy,
                Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally thought that there were two
                boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.)
                Emily states that the only condition in which she would remain married to Ross is if he stops all
                communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together,

                In the sixth season premiere, Ross and Rachel's marriage is established to be a drunken mistake.
                Ross and Rachel try to get an annulment because he doesn't want to have three divorces. However,
                he realized he couldn't do so and tried to keep their wedding a secret from Rachel. Nonetheless,
                they divorce several episodes later. Monica and Chandler move in together, causing Rachel to move
                in with Phoebe. Joey lands a role on a cable television series called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E., where
                he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating one

            <p>
                In the eighth season, it is revealed that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's
                wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy
                test is negative, in order to achieve Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant.
                Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth.
                The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy;
                Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross
                decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings
                for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale.
                At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel.
                Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket.
                Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket,
                and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees
                and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.

                due to health restrictions. Phoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd), and chooses to be
                with him over her ex-boyfriend David (Hank Azaria). Rachel and Emma move in with Joey in the middle
                of the season, and Rachel develops romantic feelings for him, while the rest of the "friends"
                try hard to get Ross and Rachel back together. The group travels to Barbados in the finale to
                hear Ross give a keynote speech at a paleontology conference. Joey and his girlfriend Charlie
                (Aisha Tyler) break up, and she begins a relationship with Ross. Joey and Rachel's feelings

            <p>
                The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back
                together with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being
                together and decide it would be best to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside
                the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica
                (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler
                — a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and
                Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel
                gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her.
                Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him.
                The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment,
                heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by
                Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys
                to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.
